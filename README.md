# Excel Data Analysis Projects 

This repository contains my data analysis projects done using Excel.

Each project focuses on working with real or sample data, cleaning it, exploring patterns, and building useful reports or dashboards. 

I’m using Excel to practice core analyst skills such as formulas, pivot tables, charts, and basic automation.
